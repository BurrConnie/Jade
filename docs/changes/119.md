# 1.19 Upgrading Guide

## Renaming

### Packages

The most noticeable difference is all the packages have been moved from `mcp.mobius.waila` to `snownee.jade`, in order not to conflict with other Hwyla fork's API.

### Types

 - `IComponentProvider` -> `IBlockComponentProvider`
 - `WailaConfig` -> `IWailaConfig`

### Methods

Some methods in the `IWailaClientRegistration` are renamed as well:

 - `registerIconProvider` -> `registerBlockIcon` / `registerEntityIcon`
 - `registerComponentProvider` -> `registerBlockComponent` / `registerEntityComponent`

## Changes in Providers

### UID

Now you need to assign a unique `ResourceLocation` id to all your component and server data providers. Id for different registries can be the same.

A plugin config will be added with the uid, so user can decide to disable your component provider or not. If you want to control how it behaves, see `IToggleableProvider`.

Now all the elements you added will be tagged with the uid by default.

### Priority

The old tooltip position system is abandoned. Now you can override `IJadeProvider#getDefaultPriority` to adjust its priority. Greater is lower. -5000 ~ 5000 is for normal providers and they will be folded in the Lite mode.

## Callbacks

Events are now simplified and should be registered in `IWailaPlugin#registerClient`. Be careful do not crash the dedicated server!

## Synced Config

Synced config doesn't exist any more, as all plugin configs can now be controlled by the server.
